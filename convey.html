<h1>IDIOT CONVEYED HIS LOVE FOR THE FIRST TIME </h1>
<p>
Oct-8, We had a biggest Quarrel about what this thing that is going on between us, <br>
and we both refused to understand that this thing was love<br>
so i decided to keep a distance for real, i might have stayed like that if he didn't<br>
took the step to talk with me, and when he talked in the morning sunday,<br>
I can't stop thinking about him, and my feelings for him started increased<br>
somehow, without my knowledge, and that plant became a forest of love<br>
after that I can't even face him directly coz i felt like loving him without <br>
my knowledge, It was the first time i gathered my confusions and came to <br>
a conclusion., I badly wanted to cry for you but i was confused why<br>
and that conclusion said that i'm loving you and even made me to cry<br>
It was a feel that can never be expressed in words<3<br>
