<h1>IDIOT CONVEYED HIS LOVE FOR THE FIRST TIME </h1>
<p>
After all the things we went through, we didn't, sorry he didn't have time to talk to me also<br>
and i didn't slept in room for long days to talk with him so i stayed one nyt<br>
we talked a lot for nearly the whole night, after that in the morning he said that<br>
he loves me for the first time as "Rabbit en aalu nu " and i fell wholly <3<br>
i didn't said becoz i wanted to tell this to you in a different way with my efforts<br>
that's why i made this for you, here it is and here i am.... hope you will smile<br>
when seeing this, and that's when there will be a use for this effort., with LOVE, "YOURS" 
</p>
