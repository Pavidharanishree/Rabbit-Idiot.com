<h1>OUR FIRST RIDE</h1>
<p>
The Best, so many next will come and go but the first one will always be the best one that stays <br>
in heart<3, And Yeah it was our first ride and it happenned in this day sep-29 2022, we did nothing<br>
but the feel i had was like we were that much close in that may be we were mentally.... only thing that<br>
hurted me was what he said, he said that we will be friends forever and don't ever get a wrong thought<br>
may be i was having some kind of thing inside me but it was hard to explain, at that time i didn't understood<br>
that it was LOVE, i got confused inside me whether i'm having feelings for you or is this just frndship as <br>
you said, i don't know but it hurted me somehow, that's when i decided to be friends even when you say<br>
that you love me. Hm., I was that confident that day <br>
<br>
And also you asked for a picture,I said no and i told everything that happenned in my past <br>
I got a feel when i said everything that i didn't even said to my sis <br>
that is how much i trusted you like a BLIND.
